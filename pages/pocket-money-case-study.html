    Pocket Money Case study
  </h1>


  <p>  
    I have used and abandoned a lot of budgets but really most of what I need to know is how much I can spend without over-drafting or breaking my savings goal. Pocket money is an app that tells you exactly how much you can spend without over-drafting at any given time.
  </p>
  <p>
    An MVP would include:
  </p>
  <ul class="browser-default">
    <li>A calendar for all recurring expenses and income</li>
    <li>A posted number stating how much you can spend right now</li>
    <li>A simple method to input expenses on the fly</li>
    <li>An no pain way to get back on track if you get behind</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>


  <h5>
    Problem:
  </h5>

  <p>
    Traditional budget apps take too much time to maintain, regardless of automation.  We need a stress free budgeting system that answers the one question you really need answers to, “How much can I spend right now?”
  </p>

  <h5>
    Hypothesis:
  </h5>
  <p>
    When setting up a budget people are over ambitious in committing to the work it will take to maintain because they are given the opportunity to over commit themselves.  When we inevitably fall short, budgeting becomes a burden and we lose motivation to catch up.  When we finally get far enough behind we give up.  If we lower the stakes and make it easy to catch up, people will stick with their budgets and get their most important questions answered.
  </p>
      
  <h5>
    Beginning Assumptions:
  </h5>
  <ul class="browser-default">
    <li>When setting up a budget people will elect to require as much info per transaction as possible</li>
    <li>When entering transactions people will enter as little information as possible</li>
    <li>When expectation of information entered falls short of reality people feel an internal sense of failure</li>
    <li>When people don’t have time to “do it right” they fall behind and give up</li>
    <li>If each transaction was less valuable (i.e. cannot track deep categories of data over time) people will be happy to ignore old unentered transactions if they can</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>
    Solution:
  </h5>
  <p>
    Limit the ability to categorize and track expenses. Make it really easy to reset the calculations and start over if you get behind by entering your current bank balance.  Limit the amount of transactions you need to enter by setting up all of your reoccurring expenses (and income) as events on a calendar that automatically rolls forward.  Automatically calculate the amount you can spend and display it prominently.
  </p>

  <h5>
    Follow up problems:
  </h5>
  <ul class="browser-default">
    <li>In order to coordinate with the bank and automatically import transactions probably requires a paid plan or a lot of security.</li>
    <li>This product makes the most sense as a mobile app (which we have not yet built).</li>
  </ul>
