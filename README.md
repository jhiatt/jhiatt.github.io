<!-- use sass --watch sass/materialize.scss:css/materialize.min.css
in development -->

Hello, 

This is Jordan Hiatt's personal site, developed entirely by me, Jordan Hiatt.  When I started I did lean on the great library from MaterializeCSS, though that is mostly phased out now, some files are still around. A shoutout to them for a great library.

Take a look around and feel free to borrow anything or send me a note with some constructive feedback.  Also look out for anything from Design Make Experiment which will be live soon.

Thanks,
Jordan
