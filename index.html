          <h3>Points Kanban</h3>
          <p>  
            There are times as a freelancer when it looks as if the 5 clients you have been courting for weeks might all work out at the same time and you just don’t have the manpower.  For some kinds of jobs, you know plenty of people looking for side projects of even just a few hours a week.  What if we had an automated system for dividing up the work and assigning value to all the deliverables that need to be completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thats when I came up with the idea for Points Kanban, a Kanban system like Trello where a project can be divided into cards and points can be awarded for those cards completed.  If the project is completed income or ownership will be divided by the number of points held by each contributor.
          </p>
          <p>
            An MVP would include:
          </p>
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>An admin user account who would have sole ability to set point amounts and approve cards submitted for completion</li>
            <li>Cards and columns set up like Trello</li>
            <li>An ability for a user to claim a card</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is my first project with a Node.js/Express backend and a React/Redux front end on a Mongoose database.
          </p>





        <!-- Points Kanban Case study

Basically Everything below is a hypothesis we are testing

Beginning Assumptions:
Freelancers have a hard time trusting each other
Freelancers would work on someone else’s project with the promise of payment upon completion
Someone or a group of people would trust a group of people working together

Problem:
No way without constant supervision and management to corral a team of freelancers

Solution:
Automate the distribution of work by assigning value to parts to complete and allowing people to choose what they will work on

Follow up problems:
How can you safeguard the amount of money allocated toward a task?
  Use Admin authority to safeguard assigned prices
What if the dollar amount of the project shifts over time
  Allocate POINTS rather than dollars.  Post the conversion to dollars publicly.
What if work isn’t up to standard?
  Work must be approved before it is merged in.  Is there a way to link Github to Kanban so that when it is merged the user automatically gets credit and the card’s status changes? -->
