        Points Kanban Case study

Basically Everything below is a hypothesis we are testing

Beginning Assumptions:
Freelancers have a hard time trusting each other
Freelancers would work on someone else’s project with the promise of payment upon completion
Someone or a group of people would trust a group of people working together

Problem:
No way without constant supervision and management to corral a team of freelancers

Solution:
Automate the distribution of work by assigning value to parts to complete and allowing people to choose what they will work on

Follow up problems:
How can you safeguard the amount of money allocated toward a task?
  Use Admin authority to safeguard assigned prices
What if the dollar amount of the project shifts over time
  Allocate POINTS rather than dollars.  Post the conversion to dollars publicly.
What if work isn’t up to standard?
  Work must be approved before it is merged in.  Is there a way to link Github to Kanban so that when it is merged the user automatically gets credit and the card’s status changes?
